# Waiting-Time-Paradox
This project demonstrates the connection between random processes and real-world phenomena like bus arrivals. By understanding these distributions, we gain insights into expected waiting times and arrival patterns.

This project simulates: Inter-arrival times for 10,000 buses.

Number of buses arriving in an hour for the same dataset.

Interpretation:

The exponential distribution models the memoryless property of inter-arrival times, meaning the time until the next bus is independent of previous arrivals.

The Poisson distribution captures the randomness of bus arrivals over fixed intervals, aligning with observed real-world systems.
